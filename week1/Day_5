## 📖 What I Learned Today

### 🔎 Nmap
- Learned how to scan all ports (`-sV -p-`).
- Understood how to detect running services and OS.
- Practiced service enumeration → only SSH (22/tcp, OpenSSH 10.0p2 Debian 5).

### 🔑 SSH Algorithms
- Learned about strong vs weak encryption algorithms.
- Identified modern ones: curve25519, chacha20, aes-gcm.
- Found legacy one: hmac-sha1 (should be disabled).

### 🛡 Vulnerability Scanning
- Used Nmap `--script vuln` to check for CVEs.
- Confirmed: no critical vulnerabilities on SSH.

### 🐍 Brute Force
- Tried Nmap `ssh-brute` → 109 attempts, no creds.
- Used Hydra with `rockyou.txt`:
  - First attempt (8 threads) → errors (too many connections).
  - Adjusted to slow reliable mode (`-t 1 -W 10`).
  - Stopped manually at ~650 attempts → no creds yet.
- Learned how to pause/resume Hydra with `-I`.

## ✅ Summary
- Learned basics of scanning, enumeration, vuln checks, brute force.  
- Understood importance of tuning Hydra (fast vs reliable).  
- Documented everything in structured reports.

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Resume Hydra brute force later.  
- Explore HTTP enumeration and SQLi basics.  
- Continue documenting progress daily in `week1/`.
