📝 Notes — Day 1

- Learned to scan ports and detect services with **Nmap** (`-sV -p-`).  
- Found only one open port → `22/tcp SSH (OpenSSH 10.0p2 Debian 5)`.  
- Used `ssh2-enum-algos` → saw strong algorithms and weak `hmac-sha1`.  
- Checked vulnerabilities with `--script vuln` → no critical CVEs.  
- Tried brute force with `ssh-brute` → no weak passwords.  
- Used **Hydra** with `rockyou.txt`:  
  - First attempt with 8 threads failed (too many connections).  
  - Switched to slow reliable mode (`-t 1 -W 10`).  
  - Stopped at ~650 attempts → no credentials yet.  
- Understood difference between fast and slow Hydra modes.  
- Prepared GitHub project with reports, theory, and summary table.

✅ **Main takeaway**: Learned full workflow — scanning, enumeration, vuln check, brute force.
